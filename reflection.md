## Team Reflection
Over the course of this project, as a collective we worked great together. Everyone responded at a decent rate and was organized on meeting times. During and after the meetings the group members always updated the team with any new functionality made within the project. As a group, everyone was approachable and helped each other set up the coding environment or helped if someone could not figure out their part. From the beginning the group worked as a team and everyone had a piece of this project that improved it.
