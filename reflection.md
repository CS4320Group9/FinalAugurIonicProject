## Team Reflection
Over the course of this project, as a collective we worked great together. Everyone responded at a decent rate and was organized on meeting times. During and after the meetings the group members always updated the team with any new functionality made within the project. As a group, everyone was approachable and helped each other set up the coding environment or helped if someone could not figure out their part. From the beginning the group worked as a team and everyone had a piece of this project that improved it. 

## Project Reflection
Looking back on our plans, use case diagrams, and eventual outcome, we were overally very proud of the work we accomplished even though some of the features of our original product fell a bit short. We believe we set our sights higher than most of the class projects, and ended up fulfilling most of our self-set goals. In the end, the one major issue we didn't have time to fix before the deadline was getting the saved data to your user, also saved in the database tied to the user. We also had to refine some of the scopes of the different pages because with the feedback we got, there wasn't much use to several of the pages.

Overall we were quite happy with the work we did on this project, and learned alot through the software development process.

One note to add is that we lost points on sprint 3 because you commented on white on white and nothing working, and we spent a long time debugging why that was, and it turns out for some reason there's a hidden variables CSS file that defaults changing styles depending on your systems operating system preference for color. So none of us could reproduce the issue, and it turns out it just looked awful for you because of your system preference, we finally found it and fixed it and hopefully you will be able to look at it again and change the grade for sprint 3.
